    "> - **Add More Tools:** Create another tool (e.g., one that returns the current date) and add its `FunctionDeclaration` to the `tools` list.\n",
    "> - **Error Handling:** What happens if the user asks for division by zero? How could you make the agent handle tool errors more gracefully?\n",
    "> - **Complex Queries:** Try asking multi-step questions like \"What is 5 plus 3, and then multiply the result by 2?\". Does the agent handle it in one go or multiple steps?\n",
    "> - **Explore Frameworks:** Libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex provide higher-level abstractions for building more complex agents."
