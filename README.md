# Practical GenAI: Building LLM-powered Applications

> AI Learning Week | Tech Track

GenAI has been around for a little while and its possibilities are ever-expanding. But the step towards actually building LLM applications can be big. How do we interact with LLMs? What do we need to consider when building RAGs or Agents? In this workshop, we will get practical. You will get a hands-on introduction in how to build your own LLM application.

During the workshop, you will learn:
1. Interfacing with **LLMs** in Python
2. Building your first **RAG**
3. Creating a simple **Agent**

## Usage

1. Follow these [setup instructions](https://github.com/dunnkers/python-uv-devcontainer?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).

2. Open the first Notebook in `./notebooks/`

3. Follow along üôåüèª
